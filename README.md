Getting Started
------
You will need **Xcode 8.3.2** to run the latest version of this app, which uses Swift 3 compiled for iOS 10.2. Xcode can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. Make sure you are not running a beta version of macOS, as Apple will prevent you from publishing to the App Store if you do.
